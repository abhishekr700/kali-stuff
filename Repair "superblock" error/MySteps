Tried to mount ex4 partition in Windows using ext2fs utility.
Turns out it corrupts the Linux ext4 filesystems , even if you have that tool installed( Yes! Without using)

Steps :
1. Uninstall that program, kill that bitch !
2. Boot to Ubuntu/Linux distro.
3. Run 
	sudo fdisk -l
   This will give a list of partitions.
4. Start fs check using,
	sudo fsck.ext4 -v /dev/xxx 
   Replace xxx by partition name.
5. Even though kali told me that it was a superblock error, I'm not sure about that
   Got an option to fix, press 'a' to fix all.
6. Kali booted successfully.

Note: The default "e2fsck" program provided in Ubuntu does not support a ext4 feature called "metadata_csum".
      It supports this feature from v1.43 onwards
      Download : http://packages.ubuntu.com/yakkety/e2fsprogs
		 http://packages.ubuntu.com/yakkety/e2fslibs
      Then install using 
		sudo dpkg -i e2fs{libs,progs}_*_$(dpkg --print-architecture).deb
      Run twice if first time one of the packages fail.

Ques: Why does this happen ?
Ans :
	Link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/849872/how-can-i-prevent-windows-10-from-corrupting-the-ext4-superblock-every-time
	The problem is related to ext2fsd which obviously does not support the 64bit feature and/or metadata_csum feature. It is 
	sufficient to have ext2fsd installed to corrupt your ext4 partitions. No need for them to be mounted in Windows.
